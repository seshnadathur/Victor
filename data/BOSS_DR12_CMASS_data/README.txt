All the data measurements contained within these files were made using a fiducial flat LCDM 
cosmological model with OmegaM = 0.307. 

The fiducial cosmology of the Big MultiDark simulation from which the templates are derived is 
OmegaM = 0.307
OmegaL = 0.693
Omegab = 0.0482
sigma_8 = 0.8228
ns = 0.96
h = 0.6777
Templates were calibrated using the z=0.52 snapshot so the implied sigma8 value at that redshift 
is sigma8(0.52) = 0.6228.
